# triphelper
In this project I created a web application to manage my own travel telegram bot.


## Stack
SpringBoot, SpringMVC, SpringData, Hibernate, Java 11, Maven.
## Information
Name of the bot: **@tripHelper**
Token: **1641679600:AAH4L_PJOzUI3Ui6QY7T_pyLLH94HuqmgN4**



## To run project:
On the command line, go to the root directory of the project (pom.xml should be located there) and execute the command: mvn clean package

After that, the target directory will appear in the root of the project, and in it, among other things, there will be a file: triphelper-1.4.jar

It is required to run this file with the command: java -jar triphelper-1.4.jar

After launch, @tripHelper will respond to your requests in telegram
